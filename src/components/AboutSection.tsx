            I'm passionate about creating at the intersection of{" "}
            <span className="text-accent-primary font-semibold">AI and engineering</span> â€” from fine-tuning large language models with LoRA/QLoRA and CUDA, to building real-time AI systems for hiring, pricing, and robotics. I've led an FTC robotics team to #1 in Ontario, founded the Scarborough STEM Alliance to bring STEM to 2,000+ students, and I'm headed to the University of Waterloo to keep exploring how AI can transform how we build, learn, and connect.
